  <h1>Learning and Teaching in the Church</h1>

  <p>Good morning, brothers and sisters. I’d like to begin by thanking the previous speakers for their messages. I’ve truly been taught and uplifted by their words today. It’s always a blessing to come to church and learn from one another, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to now share a few thoughts about learning and teaching in the gospel.</p>

  <p>In the Church, the words <strong>learning</strong> and <strong>teaching</strong> are often used — and for good reason. They are at the heart of how we grow spiritually, strengthen our testimonies, and help others come unto Christ. Whether we’re studying the scriptures, participating in a class, or sharing our testimony, we are constantly learning and teaching.</p>

  <p>What makes learning in the gospel so powerful is that it’s not just about gaining information — it’s about receiving revelation. And teaching isn’t just about explaining things — it’s about inviting the Spirit and helping others feel the truth for themselves.</p>

  <h2>Learning: A Lifelong, Spiritual Process</h2>

  <p>Heavenly Father wants us to be lifelong learners. In Doctrine and Covenants 88:118, we’re told to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith." Gospel learning involves both our minds and our hearts. It helps us become more like Jesus Christ and prepares us to make better decisions in our daily lives.</p>

  <h2>Taking Personal Responsibility for Gospel Learning</h2>

  <p>In today’s world, it’s easy to rely on others to teach us — whether it’s a Sunday School teacher, a bishop, or a trusted friend. But ultimately, the responsibility for our gospel learning is personal. No one else can develop our testimony for us. No one else can receive revelation for our lives.</p>

  <p>President Nelson has urged us repeatedly to “take charge of our own testimony.” That means setting aside time to study the scriptures, pray sincerely, and act on the promptings we receive. The Holy Ghost is always willing to teach us, but we must be willing to seek, listen, and respond.</p>

  <p>Programs like <em>Come, Follow Me</em> are designed to support us — but not replace our effort. Learning the gospel is not a passive activity. It requires our attention, effort, and real intent. As we take personal responsibility, we invite power into our lives — the power to overcome temptation, make better choices, and strengthen our relationship with Jesus Christ.</p>

  <h2>Teaching: A Responsibility for All</h2>

  <p>Just as learning is a vital part of the gospel, so is teaching. In the Church, we’re all teachers in one way or another — whether we’re giving a lesson in class, teaching our children at home, sharing our testimony, or simply being an example to others. Teaching is not limited to a formal calling; it is part of our everyday discipleship.</p>

  <p>President David O. McKay once said, “No greater responsibility can rest upon any man, than to be a teacher of God’s children.” That applies to all of us. We may not feel like experts, but when we teach with love and the Spirit, our efforts can have a powerful impact.</p>

  <p>Some of the most meaningful gospel teaching happens in the home. The Come, Follow Me program was introduced to help families and individuals take more responsibility for learning and teaching the gospel together. We don’t have to be perfect teachers — we just need to create an environment where the Spirit can be present.</p>

  <h2>Teaching with the Spirit</h2>

  <p>One of the most important parts of teaching in the Church is relying on the Holy Ghost. Teaching with the Spirit makes all the difference. Doctrine and Covenants 42:14 reminds us: “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach.”</p>

  <p>Teaching with the Spirit doesn’t mean we need to be perfect speakers or have all the answers. It means we teach with love, with humility, and with a sincere desire to help others feel the truth.</p>

  <p>A few weeks ago, I had the chance to attend a Young Men class. I watched as these young men encouraged each other to embrace the gospel and commit to living it more fully. Together, they recited the Aaronic Priesthood quorum theme:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I am a beloved son of God, and He has a work for me to do.</p>
    <p>With all my heart, might, mind, and strength, I will love God, keep my covenants, and use His priesthood to serve others, beginning in my own home.</p>
    <p>As I strive to serve, exercise faith, repent, and improve each day, I will qualify to receive temple blessings and the enduring joy of the gospel.</p>
    <p>I will prepare to become a diligent missionary, loyal husband, and loving father by being a true disciple of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>I will help prepare the world for the Savior’s return by inviting all to come unto Christ and receive the blessings of His Atonement.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As I listened to them, I felt the Spirit strongly. That’s the kind of teaching that can only happen when the Spirit is present and hearts are open.</p>

  <h2>Learning by Study and Faith</h2>

  <p>The scriptures teach us to “seek learning, even by study and also by faith” (D&C 88:118). This means combining our efforts to study with a willingness to act on what we learn. When we do, the Holy Ghost can teach us more than words alone ever could.</p>

  <p>We learn by praying, pondering, applying, and repenting. We learn by living the gospel and letting it change us day by day.</p>

  <h2>Learning and Teaching Like the Savior</h2>

  <p>Jesus Christ is the perfect teacher. He taught with love, truth, simplicity, and power. He also learned “grace for grace” (D&C 93:13). As we follow Him, we grow both as learners and as teachers.</p>

  <p>When we strive to teach like Him — with patience, love, and the Spirit — we become more like Him and help others do the same.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>Brothers and sisters, learning and teaching are essential parts of our spiritual journey. They help us grow, strengthen one another, and come closer to Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p>I’m grateful for those who have taught me and for opportunities to teach others. May we all be humble learners and faithful teachers as we strive to become true disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2>Gratitude for All Who Learn and Teach</h2>

<p>I would like to express heartfelt thanks to all who take personal responsibility in learning and teaching the gospel — from the youngest children in Primary to the youth, adults, and seniors in our wards and stakes. Your efforts, whether seen or unseen, matter deeply.</p>

<p>Thank you to parents and grandparents who teach in the home, to leaders and teachers in every organization, and to those who quietly set an example through their faith and testimony. Whether in the home, at church, or wherever we may be, your desire to learn and teach builds the Lord’s kingdom one heart at a time.</p>

  <p>I testify that He lives and that His gospel brings light and truth into our lives. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
